        <p> Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The quandary, due to its generality,
            is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-predicated optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm perspicacity, statistics, and genetic algorithms. In the operations
            research and control literature, the field where reinforcement learning methods are studied is called approximate dynamic programming. The quandary has been studied in the theory of optimal control, though most studies are concerned with the
            subsistence of optimal solutions and their characterization, and not with the cognition or approximation aspects. In economics and game theory, reinforcement learning may be habituated to expound how equilibrium may arise under bounded rationality.</p>

        <p>In machine learning, the environment is typically formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this solution utilizes dynamic programming techniques. The main distinction between the classical techniques
            and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not require cognizance about the MDP and they target immensely colossal MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.</p>

        <p>Reinforcement learning differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output dyads are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly redressed. Further, there is a fixate on on-line performance, which involves finding a
            balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current erudition). The exploration vs. exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning has been most exhaustively studied through the multi-armed bandit quandary and
            in finite MDPs</p>
