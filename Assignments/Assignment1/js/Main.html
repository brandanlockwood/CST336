  <!--Page body content-->
  <p>Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers
   the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed". Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order
   to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.</p>

  <p>Machine learning overlaps with computational statistics because the disccipline also focuses on prediction modeling. Machine learing is used in enviroments where an algorithms is not pratical. There are four different approaches to machine learning
   this includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</p>

  <h3>Algorithms to Machine Learning</h3>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Decision tree learning</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>Decision tree learning utilizes a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. It is one of the predictive modelling approaches utilized in statistics, data mining and machine
    learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called relegation trees. In these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision
    trees where the target variable can take perpetual values (typically authentic numbers) are called regression trees.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Association rule learning</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>Association rule learning is a method for discovering intriguing cognations between variables in sizably voluminous databases. It is intended to identify vigorous rules discovered in databases utilizing some measures of interestingness. Predicated
    on the concept of vigorous rules, Rakesh Agrawal et al. introduced sodality rules for discovering regularities between products in sizably voluminous-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Artficial neural networks</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>In machine learning and cognitive science, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of models inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the brain) and are habituated to estimate or approximate
    functions that can depend on a sizably voluminous number of inputs and are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected "neurons" which exchange messages between each other. The connections have
    numeric weights that can be tuned predicated on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of cognition.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Support vector machines</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, withal support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data utilized for relegation and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples,
    each marked for belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns incipient examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of
    the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. Incipient examples are then mapped into that same space and prognosticated to belong to a category predicated
    on which side of the gap they fall on.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Clustering</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that remonstrates in the same group (called a cluster) are more homogeneous (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It
    is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a familiar technique for statistical data analysis, utilized in many fields, including machine learning, pattern apperception, image analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Bayesian network</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of desultory variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG).</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Reinforcement learning</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The quandary, due to its generality,
    is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-predicated optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm perspicacity, statistics, and genetic algorithms. In the operations
    research and control literature, the field where reinforcement learning methods are studied is called approximate dynamic programming. The quandary has been studied in the theory of optimal control, though most studies are concerned with the subsistence
    of optimal solutions and their characterization, and not with the cognition or approximation aspects. In economics and game theory, reinforcement learning may be acclimated to expound how equilibrium may arise under bounded rationality.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Representation Learning</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>In machine learning, feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that learn a feature: a transformation of raw data input to a representation that can be efficaciously exploited in machine learning tasks. This obviates manual
    feature engineering, which is otherwise compulsory, and sanctions a machine to both learn at a concrete task (utilizing the features) and learn the features themselves: to learn how to learn.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Similarity and Metric Learning</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>Similarity and Metric learning is an area of supervised machine learning in artificial perspicacity. It is proximately cognate to regression and relegation, but the goal is to learn from examples a homogeneous attribute function that measures how homogeneous
    or cognate two objects are. It has applications in ranking, in recommendation systems and face verification.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="dropdown">
  <span>Genetic algorithms</span>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
   <p>In the field of artificial perspicacity, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural cull. This heuristic (additionally sometimes called a metaheuristic) is routinely used to engender utilizable solutions to optimization
    and search quandaries. Genetic algorithms belong to the more sizably voluminous class of evolutionary algorithms (EA), which engender solutions to optimization quandaries utilizing techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation,
    cull, and crossover.</p>

   Machine Learning is used in variety of fields from biometrics to businesses these companies collect data to better their products and try to best help the user. Google search engines use these to better predict what your going to search.
